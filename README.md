## Interactive Graphics Scene ##
  
### Overview ###
  This project aims to model a study scene in a simple, cozy aesthetic. 
  The scene consists of a room with a study table and a window view. 
  The laptop on the table has a digital clock that updates in real time and 
  the cup has animated smoke. 
  There are 3 different moods/vibes you can select from.
  Press 'n' to change the outside view and music.
  Press the spacebar to play/pause the music.

### Technical details ###

This project showcases geometrical modelling, animation, lighting, texture-mapping, fonts and transparency etc. in three.js. 
The most technically difficult aspect of this project so far was to combine animation with fonts in order to create the digital clock.
